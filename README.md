# XEMA Workflow Installer

One-command installer for the XEMA workflow build maintained from:

- Source repo: `https://github.com/70101520/XEMA_MAIN`
- Source branch: `XEMA_WORKFLOW`
- Installer repo: `https://github.com/70101520/xemainstaller`

## Install

Run on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 XEMA server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/70101520/xemainstaller/main/install-xema-workflow.sh | sudo bash -s -- -d -vvv
```

The script downloads and verifies the workflow package before running the official
XEMA base installer, then applies the verified package. Use a maintenance window;
the full installer restarts Asterisk and Manager. Do not run it over live calls.

## Upgrade Existing Base Install

If the official base install is already done:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/70101520/xemainstaller/main/install-xema-workflow.sh | sudo bash -s -- --skip-base
```

## What It Does

- Runs the official installer from `xema-in/install`.
- Backs up `/var/lib/xema/manager` to `/root/xema-manager-backup-<timestamp>`.
- Deploys the self-contained Linux x64 Manager package.
- Preserves local `appsettings*.json`.
- Deploys real `agent`, `admin`, `live-view`, and `data-portal` web assets.
- Includes the responsive Xema landing and redesigned Admin sign-in page.
- Includes the VM-tested AdminUI1 native CPU/RAM/disk, service, call/agent and
  floor-activity dashboard. No additional monitor is required for this page.
- Its side lists show only the verified Xema components: AsterMQ, FastAGI,
  Manager and Simple CDR. Supporting software and the absent BFF placeholder
  are not shown there; no server dependency is uninstalled.
- Includes protected Delete actions for stopped dialers and unlinked datasets.
  Delete archives the configuration; uploaded rows, batches, caches, dialplan and
  CDR history remain safe. Active/linked/uploading items are blocked. Archived
  dialer names remain reserved; a new dialer uses a new name.
- Adds the nullable archive columns automatically through normal Manager
  migrations on existing and fresh installations; no site-specific SQL is needed.
- Includes a compact Dataset/Batches/File format view with actual uploaded-record
  summaries, configured duplicate-check status, independent table sorting and
  responsive loading/error/retry states. Existing CSV mapping, batch upload,
  dialer selection and protected Delete behavior are preserved.
- Applies the Admin allowlist/password policy, secure cookies, explicit CORS
  origins and authenticated diagnostic access from the tested source.
- Applies WebRTC runtime prerequisites:
  - Asterisk websocket modules.
  - TLS certificate files.
  - nginx `/ws` proxy.
  - self-contained `xema-manager` systemd override.
- Restarts `asterisk` and `xema-manager`.
- Verifies service status and checks that stub UI pages were not deployed.

## Update Package

Required order when `XEMA_MAIN` changes:

1. Back up, deploy and test the affected workflow on the test VM. Do not publish a failed or deferred change.
2. Commit/push the verified source only to `XEMA_MAIN`'s `github/XEMA_WORKFLOW`; never contact its official Azure `origin`.
3. Build `packages/xema-workflow-linux-x64.tgz` from the same tested backend/portal artifacts, using `deploy/Build-XemaWorkflowPackage.ps1` in the source repo.
4. Verify archive contents, absence of site settings/secrets and SHA256. Update `PACKAGE_SHA256` in `install-xema-workflow.sh`.
5. Commit/push the launcher and matching archive together to this user's own installer GitHub repo. Its `origin` is GitHub, not the source repo's Azure remote.

## Tested Package: 2026-10-07

- Source commit: `a90ec31e` on `XEMA_MAIN/XEMA_WORKFLOW`.
- Archive SHA256: `3259dc96b6eafc9c45d91e28c5f68c6df471355902a80020faf51738c75ccf58`.
- Manager SHA256: `60f838846270ee313b97df25aa7802db18826dc13b37c2e6aa2f00d2aa44531c`.
- DbV2 SHA256: `33d782ca434530b406e0026871c8305b283a34c6abdaf018b3f0e2d127bb32bc`.
- 24 Angular/Chrome focused tests and 9 dashboard data/polling tests passed.
  Datasets list and detail passed 11 local/actual-VM desktop/mobile viewports
  each, including filtering, counts, navigation and loading/error/retry states.
  Failure states were injected only in browser read requests, without modifying
  server data. Existing dataset/batch/mapping data matched before and after.
  Safe deletion browser regression passed locally and on VM with real deletion
  dialogs cancelled. No outbound call or new upload was made for this UI release.
- The exact backend from the preceding 83-test release is unchanged. That
  release tested disposable pace-zero upload/append/cache/deletion fixtures,
  authorization/CSRF, active/linked guards, stale IDs and retained history.
- Archive integrity, path safety, exact tested Manager/Admin artifacts and absence
  of site settings/keys were checked. Landing/login/other portals and Manager
  dependencies match the previous release. See source
  `docs/ADMIN_DATASETS_UI_20261007.md` for the current UI changes and static
  backups; `docs/ADMIN_DIALER_DATASET_DELETE_20261007.md` retains the previous
  deletion/retention, migration and SQL/binary-backup notes.
- This release replaced Admin static files only. No service was restarted:
  Manager/Asterisk InvocationIDs and backend DLL hashes stayed identical.
  No database, site settings, TLS, nginx or Asterisk configuration was altered.
- The full clean-machine installation was not executed. Client TLS trust and
  remaining dependency advisories are documented in the source security notes.
- Fresh Admin access defaults to the installing sudo user and root. An
  SSH-key-only user needs an explicitly configured OS password; no default
  Admin password is created. See source `docs/PORTAL_SECURITY_FIX_20261007.md`.

## Rollback

If the upgrade phase fails, the script attempts to restore Manager and the backed
up runtime/security configuration automatically. Retain both the Manager backup
and its `-config` companion directory, root-only; they contain site secrets.

Manual recovery needs the matching Manager and config backup, an active-call
check and review of the target paths/services. Do not restore an older backend
casually: a pre-security-fix backup also restores its original vulnerabilities.
